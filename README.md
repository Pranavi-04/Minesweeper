This Minesweeper game is a Java-based clone, featuring a Swing interface for the graphical user interface (GUI) and AWT for event handling. One notable enhancement is the ability for users to customize the difficulty level by specifying the number of rows, columns, and mines. Additionally, a timer has been incorporated to track the duration of each game. The integration of Swing and AWT provides an interactive and responsive user experience, while the adjustable difficulty settings and timer contribute to a challenging and engaging gaming environment
